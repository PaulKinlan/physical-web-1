##The Physical Web
The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core super power of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to talk up to any smart device: e.g. a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car, and not have to download an app first in order to use it. The user experience of using smart devices should be much like we use links on web, just tap and use.

The Physical Web is, at it's base, a discovery service where URLs are broadcast and any nearby device can receive them. This takes the web we know and love and unlocks exciting new ways to interact. 

URLs are the fundamental building block of the web, giving remarkable flexibility of expression. It can be:

* a phone number
* an email address
* a web page with just a tiny paragraph of info
* a fully interactive web page
* a deep link into a native application.  

The Physical Web isn't a replacement for native apps, it's a new user experience gateway that allows for a range of interactions which can include native apps.

##Why We're Doing This
Things are best when completely open. We'd like to document how this can work but do so in a way that encourages community feedback and input.
